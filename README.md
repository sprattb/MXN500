# Guidelines for effective use of this repository

* `.Rmd` files are R markdown files, which can be knit within RStudio quite easily
* `.md` files are markdown files, which GitHub.com can render in the browser
    * use `.md` files to include plain text note documents
* Don't commit any file that gets created by knitting an RMD file
* Don't commit Word documents unless they are never, ever going to be edited
    * put these on a shared folder somewhere on AARNET's Cloudstor and link
* You can put a `README.md` file in any folder and it'll greet the user navigating the github repository
* Whenever you go to work on this, **pull** before you do anything else
* **commit** changes as you go, typically at the end of each block of work of each document; use meaningful commit messages
* **push** on a regular basis so that everyone can see the work you're doing
* Communicate any issues you're having
    * if you want someone to fix something for you, use the Issues page on the github repository
	* you can assign an Issue for something you want to fix but want to let everyone know your progress
